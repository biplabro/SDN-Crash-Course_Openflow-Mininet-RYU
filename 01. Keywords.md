*Software Defined Networking* enables centralized configurability over the network control plane that involves the routing process. The flow of the data packets over a network thus can be redirected as configured in the control plane. 

SDN network generally have three functionalities. 

	  i) application plane
 	  ii) control plane
 	  iii) data/ infrastructure plane

Forwarding & processing of the data path is configured by OpenVswitch using the OpenFlow protocol.

**Infrastructure layer** consists of the networking hardware that includes the switches & connected devices. 

**Southbound Interface** is the intermediate layer between the SDN controller and the physically connected networked hardware (Infrastructure layer)

**SDN Controller** is a piece of software running on a central computer that manages the data flow logics among all the connected network switches by receiving instructions or requirements from the SDN application layer & relaying them to the networking components. The controller communicates back with the application layer with the obtained network information from the infrastructure layer including statistics & events of what is happening downstreams.

Example: POX, NOX, RYU, OpenDayLight, FloodLight etc.

**SDN Applications** are programs that communicate behaviors and needed resources with the SDN Controller via application programming interface (APIs). These applications could include networking management, analytics, or business applications used to run large data centers. This is the place for research, innovations, new ideas etc. 

**Northbound Interface** is the intermediate layer between the SDN controller & Applications (Application layer)

**SDN switches** can be of two types

	 i) Physical switches
	 ii) Virtual switches
