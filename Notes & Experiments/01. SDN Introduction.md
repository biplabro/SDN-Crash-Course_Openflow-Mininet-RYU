# SDN Usecases

## A. OpenFlow specific usecases
Seggrigating the data & control plane. _Control plane will  moved to SDN controller & Data plane to open hardware._ Based on the defined flows, the data plane will work.

The same openflow hardware (switch) can act as multiple device roles such as router, hubs, switches, firewall etc. Some recent networked devices comes with SDN functionality or configurability support in control plane. 

**Traditional appliances**
* Switching
* Router
* VLAN (MAC based, Port based)
* Firewall (Stateful, Stateless)
* Redirection (Proxy apps such as ARP, DNS, Web etc)
* Load Balancer
* Network Monitoring/ IPS/ IDS

## B. Automated Service Delivery
This includes but not limited to on-demand services like:

**1. Bandwidth Scheduling**

As the central function unit of a generalized control plane for provisioning dedicated channels in High Performance Networks, the bandwidth scheduler computes appropriate network paths and allocates link bandwidths to meet specific user requests based on network topology and bandwidth availability. [1]

**2. Dynamic VPN**

Dynamic VPN routing allows customers to connect their production Appian Cloud instances to their resources in a secure and reliable manner. With this feature, traffic through IPSec VPN tunnels can be rerouted automatically to a secondary path as soon as a node or a connection failure is detected. Dynamic VPNs use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange routing information and reachability between Application/ Content server and customer networks. [2]

**Benefits**
* Implementation of VPN tunnels is automated
* Management software will take care of the configuration
* Optimal path to resources, settings, rate limits etc. are auto calculated by the controller
* Update VPN services based on Network resources

## C. Cloud & Network function virtualization (NFV)
Network functions virtualization (NFV) is the concept of replacing dedicated network appliances — such as routers and firewalls — with software running on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers. The aim of NFV is to transform the way communication service providers (CSPs) architect networks and deliver network services. Network operations are transformed as network function software is dynamically instantiated in various locations in the network as needed, without requiring the installation of new equipment. [3]

With NFV, we don’t need to have dedicated hardware for each network function. NFV improves scalability and agility by allowing service providers to deliver new network services and applications on demand, without requiring additional hardware resources. [4]

NFV tools: **OpenStack**, which is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed and provisioned through APIs with common authentication mechanisms. [5]

* #### Software-defined networking (SDN) and NFV

NFV and SDN are not dependent on each other, but they do have similarities. Both rely on virtualization and use network abstraction, but how they separate functions and abstract resources is different. 

SDN separates network forwarding functions from network control functions with the goal of creating a network that is centrally manageable and programmable. NFV abstracts network functions from hardware. NFV supports SDN by providing the infrastructure on which SDN software can run. 

NFV and SDN can be used together, depending on what you want to accomplish, and both use commodity hardware. With NFV and SDN, you can create a network architecture that is more flexible, programmable, and uses resources efficiently.

* #### NFV architecture consists of:

    **Virtualized network functions (VNFs)** are software applications that deliver network functions such as file sharing, directory services, and IP configuration.

    **Network functions virtualization infrastructure (NFVi)** consists of the infrastructure components—compute, storage, networking—on a platform to support software, such as a hypervisor like KVM or a container management platform, needed to run network apps.

    **Management, automation and network orchestration (MANO)** provides the framework for managing NFV infrastructure and provisioning new VNFs.

### Network wide Policy
Network/ tenant wide polict implementation use cases:

  * Allow serverA access to all hosts.
  * Block all ICMP ports in the TenantA.
  * Allow HostY to acces the internet between 8am to 10 pm at 1MBps bandwidth.
  * Allow HostX to acces the internet without ant time & bandwidth restrictions.
  * Allow SubnetA to access the internet without any time & bandwidth restrictions.

### Service Function Chain
Network service chaining, also known as service function chaining (SFC) is a capability that uses software-defined networking (SDN) capabilities to create a chain of connected network services, such as L4-7 services like firewalls, network address translation (NAT), and intrusion protection. Network operators can use this to set up suites or catalogs of pathways for traffic to travel through. Any one path can consist of any combination of connected services depending on the traffic’s requirements. Different traffic requirements might be more security, lower latency, or an overall high quality of service (QoS).

Fig.5: Service Function Chain

The technology can be operationally beneficial by enabling automated provisioning of network applications that may have different characteristics. For example, a video or voice-over-IP (VoIP) session has more demands than simple web access. Automated network service chaining can enable these sessions to be set up and torn down dynamically, without requiring human intervention. This also helps ensure that specific applications are getting the proper network resources or characteristics (bandwidth, encryption, and QoS). [6]

### Quality of Service (QoS)
The performance, reliability and availability levels of a network connection. To achieve a certain quality, network providers must have visibility into the bit rate, delay, jitter and rate in which packets are dropped in their network. They can then engineer the traffic (traffic shaping) flowing through their network to achieve a certain service quality. [7] Application based QoS enables dynamic bandwidth allocation, routing & provides better experience in network operations.

### Data Center Interconnect
DCI technology connects two or more data centers together over short, medium or long distances using high-speed packet-optical connectivity. [8]  There are many options for DCI connectivity and selecting the right one depends upon a wide range of variables, including the location of the data centers, the distance between data centers, bandwidth and availability requirements, the capabilities of local service providers and security concerns. [9]

The five key challenges in this area are:
   * Distance
   * Capacity
   * Security
   * Operations
   * Cost
