# SDN Usecases

## A. OpenFlow specific usecases
Seggrigating the data & control plane. _Control plane will  moved to SDN controller & Data plane to open hardware._ Based on the defined flows, the data plane will work.

The same openflow hardware (switch) can act as multiple device roles such as router, hubs, switches, firewall etc. Some recent networked devices comes with SDN functionality or configurability support in control plane. 

**Traditional appliances**
* Switching
* Router
* VLAN (MAC based, Port based)
* Firewall (Stateful, Stateless)
* Redirection (Proxy apps such as ARP, DNS, Web etc)
* Load Balancer
* Network Monitoring/ IPS/ IDS

## B. Automated Service Delivery
This includes but not limited to on-demand services like:

**1. Bandwidth Scheduling**

As the central function unit of a generalized control plane for provisioning dedicated channels in High Performance Networks, the bandwidth scheduler computes appropriate network paths and allocates link bandwidths to meet specific user requests based on network topology and bandwidth availability. [1]

**2. Dynamic VPN**

Dynamic VPN routing allows customers to connect their production Appian Cloud instances to their resources in a secure and reliable manner. With this feature, traffic through IPSec VPN tunnels can be rerouted automatically to a secondary path as soon as a node or a connection failure is detected. Dynamic VPNs use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange routing information and reachability between Application/ Content server and customer networks. [2]

**Benefits**
* Implementation of VPN tunnels is automated
* Management software will take care of the configuration
* Optimal path to resources, settings, rate limits etc. are auto calculated by the controller
* Update VPN services based on Network resources

## C. Cloud & Network function virtualization (NFV)
Network functions virtualization (NFV) is the concept of replacing dedicated network appliances — such as routers and firewalls — with software running on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers. The aim of NFV is to transform the way communication service providers (CSPs) architect networks and deliver network services. Network operations are transformed as network function software is dynamically instantiated in various locations in the network as needed, without requiring the installation of new equipment. [3]

With NFV, we don’t need to have dedicated hardware for each network function. NFV improves scalability and agility by allowing service providers to deliver new network services and applications on demand, without requiring additional hardware resources. [4]

NFV tools: **OpenStack**, which is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed and provisioned through APIs with common authentication mechanisms. [5]

Fig.4: SDN-vs-NFV

NFV and SDN are not dependent on each other, but they do have similarities. Both rely on virtualization and use network abstraction, but how they separate functions and abstract resources is different. 

SDN separates network forwarding functions from network control functions with the goal of creating a network that is centrally manageable and programmable. NFV abstracts network functions from hardware. NFV supports SDN by providing the infrastructure on which SDN software can run. 

NFV and SDN can be used together, depending on what you want to accomplish, and both use commodity hardware. With NFV and SDN, you can create a network architecture that is more flexible, programmable, and uses resources efficiently.

* #### NFV architecture consists of:

    **Virtualized network functions (VNFs)** are software applications that deliver network functions such as file sharing, directory services, and IP configuration.

    **Network functions virtualization infrastructure (NFVi)** consists of the infrastructure components—compute, storage, networking—on a platform to support software, such as a hypervisor like KVM or a container management platform, needed to run network apps.

    **Management, automation and network orchestration (MANO)** provides the framework for managing NFV infrastructure and provisioning new VNFs.

#### Network wide Policy
Network/ tenant wide polict implementation use cases:

  * Allow serverA access to all hosts.
  * Block all ICMP ports in the TenantA.
  * Allow HostY to acces the internet between 8am to 10 pm at 1MBps bandwidth.
  * Allow HostX to acces the internet without ant time & bandwidth restrictions.
  * Allow SubnetA to access the internet without any time & bandwidth restrictions.
