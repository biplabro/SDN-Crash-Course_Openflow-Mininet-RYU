# SDN Introduction
Software-defined networking (SDN) is an architecture designed to make a network more flexible and easier to manage. SDN centralizes management by abstracting the control plane from the data forwarding function in the discrete networking devices. [1]

*Software Defined Networking* enables centralized configurability over the network control plane that involves the routing process. The flow of the data packets over a network thus can be redirected as configured in the control plane. The purpuse is to make the Network Control directly programmable & the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted for applications & network services. 

SDN technology is an approach to cloud computing that facilitates network management and enables programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance, monitoring & scalability.

## 1. SIX Characteristics of SDN
1. Plane Separation
2. Simplified Forwarding Element
3. Centralized Control
4. Network Automation
5. Virtualization
6. Openness

## 2. SDN Value Proposition

**Agility:** Speed of networked services

**Faster time-to-market Aplications:** Deploy applications and services faster by leveraging open APIs.

**Reduced Risk:** Policy based networks (per user, per application etc.)

**Reduced Integration Delay:** Open APIs and protocols reduce time & cost of system integration. [1]

**Operational Efficiency:** Separation of control & data plane

**Reduced Spend:** CapEx, OpEx [2]

## 3. SDN Architecture

SDN network generally have three functionalities. [3]

	  i) application plane
 	  ii) control plane
 	  iii) data/ infrastructure plane

Forwarding & processing of the data path is configured by OpenVswitch using the OpenFlow protocol.

**A. Infrastructure layer** consists of the networking hardware that includes the switches & connected devices. 

**B. Southbound Interface** is the intermediate layer between the SDN controller and the physically connected networked hardware (Infrastructure layer)

**C. SDN Controller** is a piece of software running on a central computer that manages the data flow logics among all the connected network switches by receiving instructions or requirements from the SDN application layer & relaying them to the networking components. The controller communicates back with the application layer with the obtained network information from the infrastructure layer including statistics & events of what is happening downstreams.

Example: POX, NOX, RYU, OpenDayLight, FloodLight, ONOS etc.

**D. SDN Applications** are programs that communicate behaviors and needed resources with the SDN Controller via application programming interface (APIs). These applications could include networking management, analytics, or business applications used to run large data centers. This is the place for research, innovations, new ideas etc. 

**E. Northbound Interface** is the intermediate layer between the SDN controller & Applications (Application layer). The NB interface usually consists of REST APIs

_What Is A REST API?_ [5] 

An **API** is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it.

**REST** determines how the API looks like. It stands for “Representational State Transfer”. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.

Each URL is called a request while the data sent back is called a response. Let’s say we are trying to find videos about Batman on Youtube. We open up Youtube, type “Batman” into a search field, hit enter, and we see a list of videos about Batman. A REST API works in a similar way. We search for something, and we get a list of results back from the service we are requesting from.

- **SIX guiding principles of RESTful API** [6]

	1. **Client–server -** By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.

	2. **Stateless -** Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.

	3. **Cacheable -** Cache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.

	4. **Uniform interface –** By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved. In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four interface constraints
	```
		a. Identification of resources
		b. Manipulation of resources through representations
		c. Self-descriptive messages
		d. Hypermedia as the engine of application state
	```
	5. **Layered system –** The layered system style allows an architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior such that each component cannot “see” beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting.

	6. **Code on demand (optional) –** REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented.

**F. SDN switches** can be of two types

	 i) Physical switches
	 ii) Virtual switches
