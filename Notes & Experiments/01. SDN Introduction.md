# SDN Usecases

### A. OpenFlow specific usecases
Seggrigating the data & control plane. _Control plane will  moved to SDN controller & Data plane to open hardware._ Based on the defined flows, the data plane will work.

The same openflow hardware (switch) can act as multiple device roles such as router, hubs, switches, firewall etc. Some recent networked devices comes with SDN functionality or configurability support in control plane. 

**Traditional appliances**
* Switching
* Router
* VLAN (MAC based, Port based)
* Firewall (Stateful, Stateless)
* Redirection (Proxy apps such as ARP, DNS, Web etc)
