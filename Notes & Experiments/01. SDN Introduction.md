# SDN Introduction
Software-defined networking (SDN) is an architecture designed to make a network more flexible and easier to manage. SDN centralizes management by abstracting the control plane from the data forwarding function in the discrete networking devices. [1]

*Software Defined Networking* enables centralized configurability over the network control plane that involves the routing process. The flow of the data packets over a network thus can be redirected as configured in the control plane. The purpuse is to make the Network Control directly programmable & the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted for applications & network services. 

SDN technology is an approach to cloud computing that facilitates network management and enables programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance, monitoring & scalability.

## SIX Characteristics of SDN
1. Plane Separation
2. Simplified Forwarding Element
3. Centralized Control
4. Network Automation
5. Virtualization
6. Openness

## SDN Value Proposition
**Agility:** Speed of networked services
**Faster time-to-market Aplications:** Deploy applications and services faster by leveraging open APIs.

**Reduced Risk:** Policy based networks (per user, per application etc.)

**Reduced Integration Delay:** Open APIs and protocols reduce time & cost of system integration. [1]

**Operational Efficiency:** Separation of control & data plane

**Reduced Spend:** CapEx, OpEx [2]

## SDN Architecture

SDN network generally have three functionalities. 

	  i) application plane
 	  ii) control plane
 	  iii) data/ infrastructure plane

Forwarding & processing of the data path is configured by OpenVswitch using the OpenFlow protocol.

**Infrastructure layer** consists of the networking hardware that includes the switches & connected devices. 

**Southbound Interface** is the intermediate layer between the SDN controller and the physically connected networked hardware (Infrastructure layer)

**SDN Controller** is a piece of software running on a central computer that manages the data flow logics among all the connected network switches by receiving instructions or requirements from the SDN application layer & relaying them to the networking components. The controller communicates back with the application layer with the obtained network information from the infrastructure layer including statistics & events of what is happening downstreams.

Example: POX, NOX, RYU, OpenDayLight, FloodLight etc.

**SDN Applications** are programs that communicate behaviors and needed resources with the SDN Controller via application programming interface (APIs). These applications could include networking management, analytics, or business applications used to run large data centers. This is the place for research, innovations, new ideas etc. 

**Northbound Interface** is the intermediate layer between the SDN controller & Applications (Application layer)

**SDN switches** can be of two types

	 i) Physical switches
	 ii) Virtual switches
