# Mininet: Topologies

Mininet is a network emulator which creates a network of virtual hosts, switches, controllers, and links. Mininet hosts run standard Linux network software, and its switches support OpenFlow for highly flexible custom routing and Software-Defined Networking[1]. In this demonstration, we will check mininet shell, various mininet commands & understand different mininet topologies.

SDN testbed setup [article](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/03.%20Testbed%20Setup.md) covers mininet installation & version check guidelines to make sure that mininet is installed & [running](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/04.%20Testbed%20Functionality%20Rapid-Test.md) properly. 

## 1. Mininet commands

SWome important mininet commands are mentioned below that we will be used in the experiments.

|Linux Terminal commands|Functions|
|-----------------------|---------|
|mn --version|Check the installed mininet version|
|mn -c|Clean up all OVS bridges, namespaces & other components created by mininet|

The proper way to exit mininet is to run the `exit` command in mininet shell but when mininet process it stopped abruptly or mn crashes, the topology components & footprints will continue to exists. It might come up with errors while starting a new mininet instance. Here the `sudo mn -c` command comes handy to manually cleanup the entire mininet framework & components running in the backgroind.
```
*******
mininet> exit
*** Stopping 1 controllers
c0 
*** Stopping 7 links
.......
*** Stopping 4 switches
s1 s2 s3 s4 
*** Stopping 4 hosts
h1 h2 h3 h4 
*** Done
completed in 5.751 seconds

```

These commands are [investigated](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/08.%20Mininet%20Topologies.md#22-mininet-shell-commands) in the **mininet shell** when network topologies are running.

|mininet shell commands|Functions|
|-----------------------|---------|
|help|Describe available CLI commands|
|nodes|Lists all network elements|
|net|List network connections|
|links|Report on network links|
|dump|Dump node info|
|exit|Exit mininet shell|

## 2. Mininet topologies

Mininet comes with various topologies built-in. Here **Single, Linear & Tree topology** will be investigated further. First we need to run the ryu controller and do the tests accordingly. Running RYU controller in one terminal & mininet topologies in other terminal.

* Starting the SDN controller: `ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_13`

### 2.1 Single Topology

A single topology consists of a **single switch** with **multiple hosts** connected to it. In this example a single switch with 4 hosts is created[2].

* Mininet command: `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac -i 10.1.1.0/24 --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13 --topo=single,4`

![Fig.1: Single Topology](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/topo_single.png)

Fig.1: Single Topology

|Sl.|Options|Descriptions|
|---|--------|------------|
|1|--controller|Type of controller (local/remote) and remote controller ip|
|2|--mac|Automatic MAC id assignment|
|3|-i|IP range & Subnets for the Topology|
|4|--switch|Switch type (ovsk - openvswitch kernel module), and openflow version|
|5|--topo|topology type(linear,minimal,reversed,single,torus,tree) and parameters|

> mininet comes with a default controller bundled with the mininet stack. We are not using that. RYU controller is used in this experiment & the IP (**127.0.0.1**) of the controller is mentioned here to link mininet with controller interface.

> MAC addressed are assigned automatically starting from **00:00:00:00:00:01** (host-1) and so on.

Once the topology is running, we can view the switch configuration
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-vsctl show
6dae7e99-a508-4bc4-8a6b-2ad65b8a8312
    Bridge "s1"
        Controller "tcp:127.0.0.1:6653"
            is_connected: true
        Controller "ptcp:6654"
        fail_mode: secure
        Port "s1-eth3"
            Interface "s1-eth3"
        Port "s1-eth2"
            Interface "s1-eth2"
        Port "s1"
            Interface "s1"
                type: internal
        Port "s1-eth1"
            Interface "s1-eth1"
        Port "s1-eth4"
            Interface "s1-eth4"
    ovs_version: "2.9.5"
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ 
```
It shows switch **s1** is connected to all the port interfaces i.e. **s1-eth1**.....**s1-eth4**

### 2.2 Mininet Shell Commands

**nodes**
```
mininet> nodes
available nodes are: 
c0 h1 h2 h3 h4 s1
mininet>
```
It shows all the network elements listed [3]

**net**
```
mininet> net
h1 h1-eth0:s1-eth1
h2 h2-eth0:s1-eth2
h3 h3-eth0:s1-eth3
h4 h4-eth0:s1-eth4
s1 lo:  s1-eth1:h1-eth0 s1-eth2:h2-eth0 s1-eth3:h3-eth0 s1-eth4:h4-eth0
c0
mininet>
```
It shows the Host interfaces. For example 

`h1 h1-eth0:s1-eth1` **host-1 (h1) ethernet interface (h1-eth0) is connected to switch's port(s1-eth1)**, 

`h3 h3-eth0:s1-eth3` **host-3 (h3) ethernet interface (h3-eth0) is connected to switch's port(s1-eth3)** and so on 

 The switch (**s1**) connected to loopback interface (**lo**) consists of all 4 ports connected (**s1-eth1:h1-eth0 s1-eth2:h2-eth0 s1-eth3:h3-eth0 s1-eth4:h4-eth0**)
 
`c0` represents the controller

**links**
```
mininet> links
h1-eth0<->s1-eth1 (OK OK)
h2-eth0<->s1-eth2 (OK OK)
h3-eth0<->s1-eth3 (OK OK)
h4-eth0<->s1-eth4 (OK OK)
mininet>
```
`h1-eth0<->s1-eth1` **h1-eth0 is linked with s1-eth1 port of the virtual switch**. The links command not only shows the interface but also the link status which is OK. It means all the links are **up & running**.

**dump**
```
mininet> dump
<Host h1: h1-eth0:10.1.1.1 pid=7569> 
<Host h2: h2-eth0:10.1.1.2 pid=7571> 
<Host h3: h3-eth0:10.1.1.3 pid=7573> 
<Host h4: h4-eth0:10.1.1.4 pid=7575> 
<OVSSwitch{'protocols': 'OpenFlow13'} s1: lo:127.0.0.1,s1-eth1:None,s1-eth2:None,s1-eth3:None,s1-eth4:None pid=7580> 
<RemoteController{'ip': '127.0.0.1'} c0: 127.0.0.1:6653 pid=7563> 
mininet> 
```
The dump output shows the host, switch & controller information. Linux kernel allocates a separate Process ID (PID) for each networking elements.

`<Host h1: h1-eth0:10.1.1.1 pid=7569>` Host-1 interface h1-eth0 is assigned with IP 10.1.1.1 & the assigned PID id 7569.

`<OVSSwitch{'protocols': 'OpenFlow13'} s1: lo:127.0.0.1,s1-eth1:None,s1-eth2:None,s1-eth3:None,s1-eth4:None pid=7580>` OpenvSwitch is running on OpenFlow protocol version 1.3, IP is 127.0.0.1, PORTS are s1-eth1...s1-eth4 and the assigned PID is 7580.

`<RemoteController{'ip': '127.0.0.1'} c0: 127.0.0.1:6653 pid=7563>` Remote SDN controller (ryu) ip is also pointed at localhost (127.0.0.1) but the incoming port for the controller is 6653, thus any packet that does not match the switches port or matches the controller port 6653, that packet will be sent to the controller. PID for the controller element is 7563.

**ARP table update & pingall**

Similar to the traditional switch interface, the SDN environment also updates the local copy of arp table in nodes by pinging all connected hosts. 
```
mininet> h3 arp -e
mininet> pingall
*** Ping: testing ping reachability
h1 -> h2 h3 h4 
h2 -> h1 h3 h4 
h3 -> h1 h2 h4 
h4 -> h1 h2 h3 
*** Results: 0% dropped (12/12 received)
mininet> h3 arp -e
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
10.1.1.2                 ether   00:00:00:00:00:02   C                     h3-eth0
10.1.1.4                 ether   00:00:00:00:00:04   C                     h3-eth0
10.1.1.1                 ether   00:00:00:00:00:01   C                     h3-eth0
mininet>
```
As we can see above, the intial arp table is empty & after pinging all hosts the local copies are updated with all hosts IP & MAC address details.

**xterm Terminal**
For managing multiple hosts together we can either enter a command in mininet trailing with `&` to make it a background process or we can use a tool called `xterm` as a separate terminal for each hosts. xterm can be installed in ubuntu system by running `sudo apt install -y xterm` 


![Fig.2: xterm](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/xterm.png)

Fig.2: xterm

Running a host specific command directly from the mininet shell[4]: `mininet><hostname> command`
```
mininet> h3 ip route
10.1.1.0/24 dev h3-eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.1.3 
mininet> 
```

### 2.3 Linear Topology

A linear topology consists of switches connected back-to-back, each having a single host (PC) connected to each switch. To integrate with an external controller, the `--controller` option is used (In this case, the controller is running on localhost with IP address 127.0.0.1). Each switch is connected to the controller[5].

* mininet command: `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac -i 10.1.1.0/24 --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13 --topo=linear,4`

`--topo=linear,4` specifies it's a linear topology consisting of 4 hosts which essentially means that the topology consists of 4 switches since it is a linear topology.

![Fig.3: Linear topology](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Linear-Topology-mn--topo-linear-4.png)

Fig.3: Linear topology

From the above image we can see s2 has 3 links `s2-eth1:h2-eth0`, ` s2-eth2:s1-eth2`, `s2-eth3:s3-eth2`

**OVS configuration** for 4-hosts linear topology

```

### 2.4 Tree Topology

A tree topology consists of single controller & multiple switches connected based on topology **depth & fanout number**.

> **Depth** stands for the numbers of layers of switches in the network. The top layer switch (s1) is connected to (n-1) no. layers of downstream switches in every linear direction. (Depth = n) [fig.5]

> **Fanout** stands for the children nodes of each individual switch. **children can be either hosts or the next layer of switches**.

* mininet command: `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac -i 10.1.1.0/24 --topo=tree,depth=2,fanout=3`

![Fig.4: Tree topology depth=2, fanout=3](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Tree-topology.png)
