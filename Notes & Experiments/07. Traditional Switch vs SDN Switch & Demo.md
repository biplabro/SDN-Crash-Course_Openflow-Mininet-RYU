# Traditional Switch vs SDN Switch

In connection with the [previous experiment](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/06.%20Address%20Resolution%20Experiment.md#31-arp-demo), we will try to achieve the same results with an SDN switch in this experiment.

## 1. Traditional Switch (L2)

An L2 Switch is a data link layer packet switch. Its main role is to forward data link layer frames from the source end node to the destination end node within a LAN, **by looking at the destination MAC address** in the frame header.[1] Layer 3 switches have the capability of layer 2 switches to forward using destination MAC address but also the the capability to forward using layer 3 information (destination IP address)[2].

**Control Plane:** 
Learns the MAC Address from the incoming packet (initialized by ARP) and populate the MAC Table (Forwarding Table).

**Data Plane:**
When a packet needs to be sent, an L2 switch `Reads the Destination MAC from frame Header` -->> `Look-up the Forwarding Table for Destination PORT` -->> `Forwards the packet to the assigned PORT`.
