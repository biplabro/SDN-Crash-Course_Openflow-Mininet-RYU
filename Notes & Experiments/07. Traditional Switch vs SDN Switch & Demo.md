# Traditional Switch vs SDN Switch

In connection with the [previous experiment](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/06.%20Address%20Resolution%20Experiment.md#31-arp-demo), we will try to conduct the same experiment (host-1 ping host-3) to achieve similar results with an SDN switch & learn the differences.

## 1. Traditional Switch (L2)

An L2 Switch is a data link layer packet switch. Its main role is to forward data link layer frames from the source end node to the destination end node within a LAN, **by looking at the destination MAC address** in the frame header[1]. Layer 3 switches have the capability of layer 2 switches to forward using destination MAC address but also the the capability to forward using layer 3 information (destination IP address)[2].

**Control Plane:** 
Learns the MAC Address from the incoming packet (initialized by ARP) and populate the MAC Table (Forwarding Table).

**Data Plane:**
When a packet needs to be sent, an L2 switch `Reads the Destination MAC from frame Header` -->> `Look-up the Forwarding Table for Destination PORT` -->> `Forwards the packet to the assigned PORT`.

**Openvswitch is softswitch, which works as normal switch(traditional) as well as SDN(openflow)switch**

### 1.1 Traditional Switch Demo

**Print the stored Configuration Database content of OpenvSwitch**

The ovs-vsctl program configures ovs-vswitchd by providing a high-level interface to its configuration database[3]. ovs-vsctl connects to an ovsdb-server process that maintains an OpenvSwitch configuration database.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-vsctl show
6dae7e99-a508-4bc4-8a6b-2ad65b8a8312
    Bridge "s1"
        Controller "tcp:127.0.0.1:6653"
        fail_mode: standalone
        Port "s1-eth4"
            Interface "s1-eth4"
        Port "s1-eth2"
            Interface "s1-eth2"
        Port "s1-eth1"
            Interface "s1-eth1"
        Port "s1-eth3"
            Interface "s1-eth3"
        Port "s1"
            Interface "s1"
                type: internal
    ovs_version: "2.9.5"
```

**Ping all clients using mininet**
```
mininet> pingall
*** Ping: testing ping reachability
h1 -> h2 h3 h4 
h2 -> h1 h3 h4 
h3 -> h1 h2 h4 
h4 -> h1 h2 h3 
*** Results: 0% dropped (12/12 received)
mininet> 
```

**Show content of the Forwarding DB content of Switch (s1)**

Open vSwitch daemons accept certain commands at runtime to control their behavior and query their settings.[4] 
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-appctl fdb/show s1
 port  VLAN  MAC                Age
    1     0  00:00:00:00:00:01    3
    2     0  00:00:00:00:00:02    3
    4     0  00:00:00:00:00:04    3
    3     0  00:00:00:00:00:03    3
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$
```

**Dump the traffic in the OVS datapaths**

The ovs-dpctl program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch datapaths.  A single machine may host any number of datapaths.[5]
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-dpctl dump-flows 
recirc_id(0),in_port(5),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:04,dst=00:00:00:00:00:02),eth_type(0x0806), packets:0, bytes:0, used:never, actions:3
recirc_id(0),in_port(4),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:03,dst=00:00:00:00:00:04),eth_type(0x0806), packets:1, bytes:42, used:7.937s, actions:5
recirc_id(0),in_port(2),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dst=00:00:00:00:00:03),eth_type(0x0806), packets:0, bytes:0, used:never, actions:4
recirc_id(0),in_port(2),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dst=00:00:00:00:00:04),eth_type(0x0806), packets:1, bytes:42, used:7.937s, actions:5
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ ^C
```

**Working procedure & Inferences**

- Traditional Switches comes with built-in Control & Data planes.
- MAC table is initially empty when the switch starts. Now the forwarding table comes into picture.
- From the incoming packets, **Control plane**, updates the MAC table & map with PORT numbers.
- When packets arrive, the **Data Plane** looks at the MAC table & if a suitable match is found, the packet is forwarded to respective port. 

## 2. SDN (OpenFlow) Switch

OpenFlow is a communication protocol in the area of software-defined networking (SDN). It enables to access the control plane of a router or a switch and to control the forwarding of packets[6].

- This allows the control logic of the network to move to an external controller.
- The routing of packets is no longer controlled by the router or the switch, but by the application in the controller.

![Fig.1: OpenFlow Switch](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/OpenFlow-protocol.jpg)

Fig.1: OpenFlow Switch

An OpenFlow switch is an OpenFlow-enabled data switch that communicates over OpenFlow channel to an external controller. It performs packet lookup and forwarding according to one or more flow tables and a group table. The OpenFlow switch communicates with the controller and the controller manages the switch via the OpenFlow switch protocol. OpenFlow switches are either based on the OpenFlow protocol or compatible with it[7].

**SDN Switch over Traditional Switch**
- With OpenFlow switch, the SDN controller could route noncritical/bulk traffic on longer routes that are not fully utilized.
- The SDN controller can easily implement load-balancing at high data rates by just directing different flows to different hosts, only doing the set-up of the initial flowâ€™s.
- Traffic can be isolated without the need for VLANs, the SDN controller of the OpenFlow switch can just refuse certain connections.
- Setup a network TAP/Sniffer easily for any port or even specific traffic by programming the network to send a duplicate stream to a network monitoring device.
- OpenFlow switch allows for the development of new services and ideas all in software on the SDN controller, as well to accelerate new features and services.
