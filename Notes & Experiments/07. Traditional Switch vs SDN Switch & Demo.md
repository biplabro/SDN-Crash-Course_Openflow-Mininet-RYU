# Traditional Switch vs SDN Switch

In connection with the [previous experiment](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/06.%20Address%20Resolution%20Experiment.md#31-arp-demo), we will try to achieve the same results with an SDN switch in this experiment.

## 1. Traditional Switch (L2)

An L2 Switch is a data link layer packet switch. Its main role is to forward data link layer frames from the source end node to the destination end node within a LAN, **by looking at the destination MAC address** in the frame header.[1] Layer 3 switches have the capability of layer 2 switches to forward using destination MAC address but also the the capability to forward using layer 3 information (destination IP address)[2].

**Control Plane:** 
Learns the MAC Address from the incoming packet (initialized by ARP) and populate the MAC Table (Forwarding Table).

**Data Plane:**
When a packet needs to be sent, an L2 switch `Reads the Destination MAC from frame Header` -->> `Look-up the Forwarding Table for Destination PORT` -->> `Forwards the packet to the assigned PORT`.

**Openvswitch is softswitch, which works as normal switch(traditional) as well as SDN(openflow)switch**

### 1.1 Traditional Switch Demo

**Print the stored Configuration Database content of OpenvSwitch**

The ovs-vsctl program configures ovs-vswitchd by providing a high-level interface to its configuration database[3]. ovs-vsctl connects to an ovsdb-server process that maintains an OpenvSwitch configuration database.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-vsctl show
6dae7e99-a508-4bc4-8a6b-2ad65b8a8312
    Bridge "s1"
        Controller "tcp:127.0.0.1:6653"
        fail_mode: standalone
        Port "s1-eth4"
            Interface "s1-eth4"
        Port "s1-eth2"
            Interface "s1-eth2"
        Port "s1-eth1"
            Interface "s1-eth1"
        Port "s1-eth3"
            Interface "s1-eth3"
        Port "s1"
            Interface "s1"
                type: internal
    ovs_version: "2.9.5"
```

**Ping all clients using mininet**
```
mininet> pingall
*** Ping: testing ping reachability
h1 -> h2 h3 h4 
h2 -> h1 h3 h4 
h3 -> h1 h2 h4 
h4 -> h1 h2 h3 
*** Results: 0% dropped (12/12 received)
mininet> 
```

**Show content of the Forwarding DB content of Switch (s1)**

Open vSwitch daemons accept certain commands at runtime to control their behavior and query their settings.[4] 
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-appctl fdb/show s1
 port  VLAN  MAC                Age
    1     0  00:00:00:00:00:01    3
    2     0  00:00:00:00:00:02    3
    4     0  00:00:00:00:00:04    3
    3     0  00:00:00:00:00:03    3
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$
```

**Dump the traffic in the OVS datapaths**

The ovs-dpctl program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch datapaths.  A single machine may host any number of datapaths.[5]
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-dpctl dump-flows 
recirc_id(0),in_port(5),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:04,dst=00:00:00:00:00:02),eth_type(0x0806), packets:0, bytes:0, used:never, actions:3
recirc_id(0),in_port(4),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:03,dst=00:00:00:00:00:04),eth_type(0x0806), packets:1, bytes:42, used:7.937s, actions:5
recirc_id(0),in_port(2),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dst=00:00:00:00:00:03),eth_type(0x0806), packets:0, bytes:0, used:never, actions:4
recirc_id(0),in_port(2),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dst=00:00:00:00:00:04),eth_type(0x0806), packets:1, bytes:42, used:7.937s, actions:5
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ ^C
```

**Working procedure & Inferences**

- Traditional Switches comes with built-in Control & Data planes.
- MAC table is initially empty when the switch starts. Now the forwarding table comes into picture.
- From the incoming packets, **Control plane**, updates the MAC table & map with PORT numbers.
- When packets arrive, the **Data Plane** looks at the MAC table & if a suitable match is found, the packet is forwarded to respective port.
