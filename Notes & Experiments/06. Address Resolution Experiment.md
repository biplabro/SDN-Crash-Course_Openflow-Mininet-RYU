# Address Resolution Experiment
This article ia a brief introduction of *Neighbour Discovery Protocol(NDP)*, more specifically *Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)* & a simple Demo of ARP using **mininet**.

## 1. Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP)

Similar to IPv4's ARP, IPv6's NDP is used to discover the Link Layer Address (MAC) of available Hosts or connection information of available Routers.

IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a set of messages and processes defined in [RFC 4861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861) that determine relationships between neighboring nodes. ND replaces Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) router discovery, and the ICMP Redirect message used in IPv4. NDP performs at the Link Layer of OSI model performing the following major activities on the IPv6 local link: [1]

* **Router discovery –** Aids hosts in locating routers on the local link.

* **Address autoconfiguration –** Enables a node to automatically configure IPv6 addresses for its interfaces.

* **Prefix discovery –** Enables nodes to discover the known subnet prefixes that have been allocated to a link. Nodes use prefixes to distinguish destinations that are on the local link from those destinations that are only reachable through a router.

* **Address resolution –** Helps nodes to determine the link-local address of a neighbor, given only the destinations's IP address.

* **Next-hop determination –** Uses an algorithm to determine the IP address of a packet recipient one hop that is beyond the local link. The next-hop can be a router or the destination node.

* **Neighbor unreachability detection –** Aids nodes to determine if a neighbor is no longer reachable. For both routers and hosts, address resolution can be repeated.

* **Duplicate address detection –** Enables a node to determine if an address that the node wants to use is not already in use.

* **Redirection –** Enables a router to inform a host of a better first-hop node to use to reach a particular destination.

NDP uses Internet Control Message Protocol version6 **(ICMPv6) which is an integral part of IPv6**. ICMPv6 is used by IPv6 nodes to **report error messages and perform informational functions**. [2]

### 1.1 NDP ICMPv6 packet types

NDP includes 5 types of ICMPv6 packets.

    1. Router Solicitation (RS)
    2. Router Advertisement (RA)
    3. Neighbour Solicitation (NS)
    4. Neighbour Advertisement (NA)
    5. Redirect Message (RM)

#### 1.1.1 Router Solicitation (ICMPv6 type 133)

When a computer wants to connect to a network, it transmits **all-router multicast request** to locate routers in the local link. It requests the network to provide router addressing information. This message is called RS. 

![Fig.1: Router Solicitation](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Router%20Solicitation.jpg)

Fig.1: Router Solicitation

RS message includes two types of information **RS Header** & **RS Data**.

#### 1.1.2 Router Advertisement (ICMPv6 type 134)

In response to RS, all the routers in the network send **all-node multicast packet**. This packet is called RA.

![Fig.2: Router Advertisement](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Router%20Advertisement.jpg)

Fig.2: Router Advertisement

RA packet includes two types of information **RA Header** & **RA Data**. Practically. every router multicasts RA message to every node periodically. Whenever a new node is added to the network, the router sends RA signal to the node immediately without waiting for the next schedule.  

#### 1.1.3 Neighbour Solicitation (ICMPv6 type 135)

NS is used by the nodes in a network to **determine the (MAC)** link layer address of a neighbour or to verify **if the neighbour is still reachable**. 

![Fig.3: Neighbour Solicitation](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Neighbour%20Solicitation.jpg)

Fig.3: Neighbour Solicitation

#### 1.1.4 Neighbour Advertisement (ICMPv6 type 136)

NA message includes the MAC address of the **neighbouring nodes**.

![Fig.4: Neighbour Advertisement](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Neighbour%20Advertisement.jpg)

Fig.4: Neighbour Advertisement

#### 1.1.5 Redirect Message (ICMPv6 type 137)

A router sends redirect message to **inform a host of better first-hop node** on the path to a destination. The better first-hop could be a different router or the destination itself.

![Fig.5: Redirect Mesage](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Redirect%20Message.jpg)

Fig.5: Redirect Mesage

**SUMMARY:** NDP uses ICMPv6 messages & solicited-node multicast addresses to find the link layer address of a neighbour on a local network.

## 2. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

Address Resolution Protocol is **address mapping technique used to dynamically map the logical address (IP address) used at network layer to physical address (MAC address) used at data link layer**. Package of Address Resolution protocol consist of cache table, queues, output module, input module and cache control module. Address Resolution protocol consist of  Hardware type, protocol type, Hardware length, protocol length, operations like request and reply, hardware address of sender, protocol address of sender, hardware address of target and protocol address of target. [3]

> Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a **layer 2 protocol** since it maps an Internet Protocol address (IP address, Layer 3) to a physical machine address (Mac address, Layer 2) that is recognized in the local network. **An ARP frame is not routable**, it does not get pass the local LAN. [4]

### 2.1 ARP working procedure

![Fig.6: ARP working procedure](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/ARP.jpg)

Fig.6: ARP working procedure

Systems keep an **ARP look-up table** where they store information about what IP addresses are associated with what MAC addresses within the local network. 

* When trying to send a packet to an IP address, the system will first consult this table to see if it already knows the MAC address. **If there is a value cached, ARP is not used**.

* If the IP address is not found in the ARP table, the system will then send a ARP request **broadcast packet** containing the IP address of the intended receiving device. 
    * ARP request packets are sent to the broadcast addresses (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF for the Ethernet broadcasts and 255.255.255.255 for the IP broadcast). [5]

* All devices on a local network segment see the message, but **only the intended device** (having the specific IP address) responds with the **unicast ARP reply message containing its MAC address**. 

* The sending device now has enough information **(MAC & IP address)** to send the packet to the specific receiving device.

## 3. ARP Operations

Arp is part of the net-tools package. We need to make sure it is installed in the system.[6] 
Installation: `sudo apt-get install net-tools`. 

To find other connected devices to a specific network we need the `arp-scan` package. 
Installation: `sudo apt-get install arp-scan`

Below is the network scheme on which the arp table is demonstrated

![Fig.7: Network scheme](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Network%20Scheme.png)

Fig.7: Network scheme

> `arp -a` for showing entries for a specific host

> `arp -e` same as above except it uses the default linux format for the output

> `arp -d <IP>` delete a specific entry from the arp table.

**Checking the local copy of ARP table**

![Fig.8: Network interface & ARP table](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/arp%20table.png)

Fig.8: Network interface & ARP table

`ifconfig` confirms the network interface is **enp0s3** (ethernet, in virtualbox setup) MAC(08:00:27:07:fd:44) & IP (192.168.31.197)

* The local copy of arp includes the details of two neighbours i) Linux HOST machine (192.168.31.156) in which the virtualbox is set-up and ii) Local wifi router (192.168.31.1) which is connected to the ISP. Though the actual interface is **wireless**, the arp detects it as **ethernet** because legacy wireless devices **still use the ethernet frame structure**. [7]

**Checking the Local Network using arp-scan package**

We will use the following command to scan the local network. In this demo only the ethernet interface is scanned thus the `--interface` is optional.
`-l` or `--localnet` specifies the local network. [8]

![Fig.9: arp-scan of local network](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/arp-scan.png)

Fig.9: arp-scan of local network

Additionally we have used a gui tool called angry ip-scanner to confirm the results.

![Fig.10: angry IP-scanner](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/ip-scanner.png)

**Deleting arp table entry**

To delete an arp entry we can use  `arp -d <IP>`

![Fig.11: ARP delete entry](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/arp-delete.png)

### 3.1 ARP Demo

This below experiment demonstrates how ARP works, referenced to [Fig.6]. We see it from a Traditional Switch perspective where the Control & data planes are integrated.

**A. Starting Linear Topology in mininet**

SDN controoler is NOT connected in the topology at this stage. All the HOST objects are created using python script where 'c1', represents the controller object (ip='127.0.0.1') and **all traffic are routed through `localhost`**. Note: the script has to be run with **sudo** privilege

```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo python ~/Documents/SDN_hands-on/traditional_switch.py 
Unable to contact the remote controller at 127.0.0.1:6653
Unable to contact the remote controller at 127.0.0.1:6633
Setting remote controller to 127.0.0.1:6653
*** Creating network
*** Adding controller
*** Adding hosts:
h1 h2 h3 h4 
*** Adding switches:
s1 
*** Adding links:
(h1, s1) (h2, s1) (h3, s1) (h4, s1) 
*** Configuring hosts
h1 h2 h3 h4 
*** Starting controller
c1 
*** Starting 1 switches
s1 ...
*** Starting CLI:
mininet>
```

To run the script `sudo python <path_to_the_script.py>`. [Traditional_Switch: Code](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Scripts%20%26%20Code/traditional_switch.py)

The above script does:

* Create Network topology
* Adds controller (remote=localhost)
* Adds switch in the linear topology
* adds links (switch to hosts)
* configures HOSTs (h1, h2, h3, h4)
* Starts controller & switch in the topology

**B. Identifying links using the mininet**

```
mininet> links
h1-eth0<->s1-eth1 (OK OK)
h2-eth0<->s1-eth2 (OK OK)
h3-eth0<->s1-eth3 (OK OK)
h4-eth0<->s1-eth4 (OK OK)
mininet> 
```

**C. Capture network traces of HOST-3 using wireshark**

Ping h3 from h1 & capture the traces of `s1-eth3` interface using wireshark to demonstrate the ARP functionality.

![Fig.12: Starting wireshark with capture options set to s1-eth3](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/ws-arp.png)

Fig.12: Starting wireshark with capture options set to s1-eth3

Ping host-3 from host-1 `h1 ping h3` in mininet console. This will initiate the ARP functionality & wireshark successfully captures the packets.

![Fig.13: ARP-capture Wireshark](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/ARP_response.jpg)

Fig.13: ARP-capture Wireshark

1. broadcast messg sent from h1 (MAC- 00:00:00:00:00:01) to all hosts (MAC- FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
2. response from h3 (MAC- 00:00:00:00:00:01) the IP adress of its own (192.168.1.3) sent to h1
3. H1 sends a ping **request** to h3
4. H3 sends a ping **reply** to h1

**ARP table update**

after pinging h3 the local copy of ARP in h3 contains:
```
mininet> h3 arp -e
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
192.168.1.1              ether   00:00:00:00:00:01   C                     h3-eth0
```

Ping all hosts:
```
mininet> pingall
*** Ping: testing ping reachability
h1 -> h2 h3 h4 
h2 -> h1 h3 h4 
h3 -> h1 h2 h4 
h4 -> h1 h2 h3 
*** Results: 0% dropped (12/12 received)
```
ARP table of h3 after pinging all hosts:
```
mininet> h3 arp -e
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
192.168.1.4              ether   00:00:00:00:00:04   C                     h3-eth0
192.168.1.1              ether   00:00:00:00:00:01   C                     h3-eth0
192.168.1.2              ether   00:00:00:00:00:02   C                     h3-eth0
mininet> 
```

It certainly shows that all hosts MAC are mapped w.r.t. their IP addresses & the information is stored inside the local copy of ARP table.
