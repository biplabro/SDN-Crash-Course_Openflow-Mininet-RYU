# Mininet Topologies
In this demonstration, we will check mininet shell, various mininet commands & understand different mininet topologies.

SDN testbed setup [article](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/03.%20Testbed%20Setup.md) covers mininet installation & version check guidelines to make sure that mininet is installed & [running](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/04.%20Testbed%20Functionality%20Rapid-Test.md) properly. 

## 1. Important mininet commands

SWome important mininet commands are mentioned below that we will be used in the experiments.

|Linux Terminal commands|Functions|
