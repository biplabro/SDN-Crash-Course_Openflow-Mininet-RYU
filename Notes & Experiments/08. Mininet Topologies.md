# Mininet Topologies
In this demonstration, we will check mininet shell, various mininet commands & understand different mininet topologies.

SDN testbed setup [article](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/03.%20Testbed%20Setup.md) covers mininet installation & version check guidelines to make sure that mininet is installed & [running](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/04.%20Testbed%20Functionality%20Rapid-Test.md) properly. 

## 1. Important mininet commands

SWome important mininet commands are mentioned below that we will be used in the experiments.

|Linux Terminal commands|Functions|
|-----------------------|---------|
|mn --version|Check the installed mininet version|
|mn -c|Clean up all OVS bridges, namespaces & other objects created by mininet|

When mininet process it stopped abruptly, it might come up with errors while starting a new mininet instance, here the `mn -c` command comes handy to cleanup the entire mininet framework running in the backgroind. The proper way to exit mininet is to run the `exit` command in mininet shell.
```
*******
mininet> exit
*** Stopping 1 controllers
c0 
*** Stopping 7 links
.......
*** Stopping 4 switches
s1 s2 s3 s4 
*** Stopping 4 hosts
h1 h2 h3 h4 
*** Done

```

These commands are investigated when network topologies are running.

|mininet shell commands|Functions|
|-----------------------|---------|
|help|Describe available CLI commands|
|net|List network connections|
|dump|Dump node info|
|links|Report on network links|
|exit|Exit mininet shell|
