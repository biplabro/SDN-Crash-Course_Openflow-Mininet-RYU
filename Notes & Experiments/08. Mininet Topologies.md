# Mininet Topologies

Mininet is a network emulator which creates a network of virtual hosts, switches, controllers, and links. Mininet hosts run standard Linux network software, and its switches support OpenFlow for highly flexible custom routing and Software-Defined Networking[1]. In this demonstration, we will check mininet shell, various mininet commands & understand different mininet topologies.

SDN testbed setup [article](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/03.%20Testbed%20Setup.md) covers mininet installation & version check guidelines to make sure that mininet is installed & [running](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/04.%20Testbed%20Functionality%20Rapid-Test.md) properly. 

## 1. Mininet commands

SWome important mininet commands are mentioned below that we will be used in the experiments.

|Linux Terminal commands|Functions|
|-----------------------|---------|
|mn --version|Check the installed mininet version|
|mn -c|Clean up all OVS bridges, namespaces & other components created by mininet|

The proper way to exit mininet is to run the `exit` command in mininet shell but when mininet process it stopped abruptly or mn crashes, the topology components & footprints will continue to exists. It might come up with errors while starting a new mininet instance. Here the `sudo mn -c` command comes handy to manually cleanup the entire mininet framework & components running in the backgroind.
```
*******
mininet> exit
*** Stopping 1 controllers
c0 
*** Stopping 7 links
.......
*** Stopping 4 switches
s1 s2 s3 s4 
*** Stopping 4 hosts
h1 h2 h3 h4 
*** Done
completed in 5.751 seconds
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ 
```

These commands are investigated when network topologies are running.

|mininet shell commands|Functions|
|-----------------------|---------|
|help|Describe available CLI commands|
|net|List network connections|
|links|Report on network links|
|dump|Dump node info|
|exit|Exit mininet shell|

## 2. Mininet topologies

Mininet comes with various topologies built-in. Here **Single, Linear & Tree topology** will be investigated further. First we need to run the ryu controller and do the tests accordingly. Running RYU controller in one terminal & mininet topologies in other terminal.

* Starting the SDN controller: `ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_13`

### 2.1 Single topology

A single topology consists of a **single switch** with **multiple hosts** connected to it. In this example a single switch with 4 hosts is created[2].

* Mininet command: `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac -i 10.1.1.0/24 --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13 --topo=single,4`

Fig.1: Single Topology

|Sl.|Options|Descriptions|
|---|--------|------------|
|1|--controller|Type of controller (local/remote) and remote controller ip|
|2|--mac|Automatic MAC id assignment|
|3|-i|IP range & Subnets for the Topology|
|4|--switch|Switch type (ovsk - openvswitch kernel module), and openflow version|
|5|--topo|topology type(linear,minimal,reversed,single,torus,tree) and parameters|

> mininet comes with a default controller bundled with the mininet stack. We are not using that. RYU controller is used in this experiment & the IP (**127.0.0.1**) of the controller is mentioned here to link mininet with controller interface.

> MAC addressed are assigned automatically starting from **00:00:00:00:00:01** (host-1) and so on.

Once the topology is running, we can view the switch configuration
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-vsctl show
6dae7e99-a508-4bc4-8a6b-2ad65b8a8312
    Bridge "s1"
        Controller "tcp:127.0.0.1:6653"
            is_connected: true
        Controller "ptcp:6654"
        fail_mode: secure
        Port "s1-eth3"
            Interface "s1-eth3"
        Port "s1-eth2"
            Interface "s1-eth2"
        Port "s1"
            Interface "s1"
                type: internal
        Port "s1-eth1"
            Interface "s1-eth1"
        Port "s1-eth4"
            Interface "s1-eth4"
    ovs_version: "2.9.5"
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ 
```
It shows switch **s1** is connected to all the port interfaces i.e. **s1-eth1**.....**s1-eth4**
