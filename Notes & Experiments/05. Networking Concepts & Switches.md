# Networking Concepts & Switches

## 1. Network Layers

To understand the core concepts & functionality of a network, it is divided in multiple segments depending on their tasks, protocols & specifications. Each such segment is called a Layer. 

In a software defined network, these segments are majorly divided into 4 layers unlike the 7 layer OSI model which can deconstruct a traditional network scheme in greater detail.

Fig.1: TCP/IP vs OSI Comparison [1]

### 1.1 Similarities between OSI and TCP / IP Reference Models

* Both the reference models are based upon layered architecture. The layers in the models are compared with each other. [2]
* The physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model correspond to the link layer of the TCP/IP model. 
* The network layers and the transport layers are the same in both the models. 
* The session layer, presentation layer and application layer of the OSI model together form the application layer of the TCP/IP model.
* In both the models, protocols are defined in a layer-wise manner.
* In both models, data is divided into packets and each packet may take the individual route from the source to the destination.

### 1.2 Differences between OSI and TCP / IP Reference Models

|OSI Model|TCP/IP Model|
|:---------:|:------------:|
|Functionality oriented layer separation|Protocol oriented layer separation|
|Focuses on guidelines of communication|Focuses on protocol implementation of communication|
|Model first, Protocols are derived|Protocols First, Models is derived|
|Consists of 7 layers|Consists of 4 layers|

## 2. Packet Capture Engine

> A **packet** is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them. [3]

**WireShark Features**
* GUI based network traffic capture & protocol analyzer
* It can capture packets from multiple interfaces like Ethernet, USB, Serial port, Loopback address etc.
* Default feature of structured representation of the captured data packet

### 2.1 Wireshark Example

In the below example we will try to capture data packets & interpret the information by the following steps 

```Starting Wireshark to capture "all interfaces" -->> Ping/ curl a certain website using Linux terminal -->> Analyze captured data packets to extract information.```

Initialization of wireshark tool & setting the capture interface to "any" for capturing all ongoing traffic.

**Extracted Information**

  1. Packet is `unicasted` (IP + MAC identifier) to user/client from google. `Local Router vendor: Xiaomi, Router MAC: 50:64:2B:CE:B2:55`
  2. Source IP (google): `142.250.67.206`, Destination IP (client): `192.168.31.197`
  3. TCP Port: user ==> `80 (HTTP)`, Google ==> 43638
  4. Received HTTP `response Header`
  5. Received `text` from [google.com](www.google.com)

## 3. Ethernet Concepts

In 1980-81, the first Ethernet standard was developed by Digital (DEC-Digital Equipment Corporation), Intel, and Xerox, and combined the first letter of all of their names. This standard is called DIX 1.0, sometimes referred to as Ethernet I. The standard was superseded in 1982, by DIX 2.0, the current Ethernet standard, also known as Ethernet II (or Ethernet Version 2).[4]

* Ethernet is a **Layer 2** concept (Layer 2 for OSI model, Layer 1 for TCP/IP model i.e. Link layer; from incoming traffic direction perspective) [5]
* Used majorly in LAN networking setup where **higher datarates** needs to be achieved over **relatively shorter** distance (100m over twisted pair).
* Interface naming convention **eth0, eth1, eth2,** etc.
* Preferred topologies: **Point-to-Point, star, Bus**
* In modern Ethernet interfaces the maximum speed can reach upto **400Gbit/s**
* MAC Address is a **Layer 2 address** which consists of **48 bits** seperated into 6 bytes (e.g: 40:5A:FA:22:BC:2D)

### 3.1 Ethernet Frame

An Ethernet Frame is the **way of arranging sections of data** that is transmitted over a computer network. It includes **Overhead** (sync, error check etc.) and **Payload** (The actual information) [6]. An Ethernet frame must be **at least 64 bytes** for collision detection to work, and can be a maximum of 1,518 bytes.[7]

#### 3.1.1 Frame Format (IEEE 802.3)

![Fig.7: Ethernet Frame](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/EN-ethernet-frame-structure.jpg)

Fig.7: Ethernet Frame Format (IEEE 802.3)

* **Preamble:** Ethernet frame starts with 7-Bytes Preamble. It is a alternative pattern of 0’s and 1’s indicating starting of the frame and allow sender and receiver to establish bit synchronization to remove frame drops. [8]
* **Start of frame delimiter (SFD):** It is sometimes considered as a part of the 8byte preamble being the last static byte as 10101011. SFD is like a final reminder of synchronization & lock with the data stream. 
* **Destination Address:** It includes the 48bit destination MAC address of the destination ethernet adapter/ machine for which data is destined. 
* **Source Address:** This is a 6-Byte field which contains the MAC address of source machine. As Source Address is always an individual addres **(Unicast)**, the least significant bit of first byte is always 0.
* **Length:** Length is a 2-Byte field, which indicates the length of entire Ethernet frame. This 16-bit field can hold the length value between 0 to 65534, but the length field in IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frames is always less than hex '05DC'. This corresponds to 1500 bytes which is the maximum frame size for Ethernet.
* **Data:** This field size will be a minimum of 46 bytes long and a maximum of 1500 bytes. This is the place where actual data is inserted, also known as Payload. Both IP header and data will be inserted here if Internet Protocol is used over Ethernet.
  * **Pad:** This field size can be 0 to 46 bytes long. This will add **additional 0's**, the data size is less than 46 bytes as a 802.3 frame must be at least 64 bytes long. [9]
* **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):**  CRC is 4 Byte field. This field contains a 32-bits hash code of data, which is generated over the Destination Address, Source Address, Length, and Data field. If the checksum computed by destination is not the same as sent checksum value, data received is corrupted.

#### 3.1.2 Frame Format (Ethernet II, DIX)

The standardized frame structure of Ethernet 802.3. New features are **DSAP** and **SSAP**, which replace the **Type** field (Ethernet-II) and the control field containing the LLC frame.

|Ether Type |	Protocol|
|-----------|---------|
|0x0800 |	Internet Protocol, Version 4 (IPv4)|
|0x0806 |	Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)|
|0x8035 |	Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)|
|0x8100 |	VLAN-tagged frame (IEEE 802.1Q)|
|0x814C |	Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)|
|0x86DD |	Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6)|
|0x8847 |	MPLS unicast|
|0x8848 |	MPLS multicast|
|0x8870 |	Jumbo Frames|
|0x888E |	EAP over LAN (IEEE 802.1X)|
|0x88E5 |	MAC security (IEEE 802.1AE)|
|0x88F7 |	Precision Time Protocol (IEEE 1588)|

Fig.8: Ethernet II Frame Format (DIX)

*Additional Fields:*

* **DSAP:** Destination Service Access Point, 1 byte.
* **SSAP:** Source Service Access Point, 1 byte.
* **Control:** Control Field, 1 byte, defines the "Logical Link" (LLC) of the protocol. This point ensures the transparency of the media sharing procedures and can control the data flow. [7]
* **FCS (Frame Checksum):** 4 bytes CRC checksum
