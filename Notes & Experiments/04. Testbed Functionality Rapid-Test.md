# Testbed Functionality Rapid-Test

Once all the tools & setup is completed from the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20&%20Experiments/03.%20Testbed%20Setup.md#tools-installation), we will further proceed into testing the functionality of the testbed.

Need to open 4 terminals ```CTRL+ALT+T```

In Terminal 1:

Start wireshark with superuser privilages ```sudo wireshark``` to capture the data packets. There are better ways to give root privilages to ```dumpcap``` package [1] which is actually responsible for packet capturing. [2]
