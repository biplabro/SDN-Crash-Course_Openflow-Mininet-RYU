# Testbed Functionality Rapid-Test

Once all the tools & setup is completed from the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20&%20Experiments/03.%20Testbed%20Setup.md#tools-installation), we will further proceed into testing the functionality of the testbed.

## 1. Test Algorithm

Fig.1: Testing-Algo

## 2. Testing

Need to open 4 terminals ```CTRL+ALT+T```

### Terminal 1:
Starting the packet capture engine

Wireshark is started with superuser privilages ```sudo wireshark``` to capture the data packets. There are better ways to give root privilages to ```dumpcap``` package [1] which is actually responsible for packet capturing. [2] 

In the GUI, loopback is selected for packet capturing. ```Interface--> Capture--> Options--> select "loopback"--> Start```

Fig.2: Wireshark-Interface

> A **loopback address** is a special IP address, 127.0.0.1, reserved by InterNIC for use in testing network cards. This IP address corresponds to the software loopback interface of the network card, which does not have hardware associated with it, and does not require a physical connection to a network. The loopback address allows for a reliable method of testing the functionality of an Ethernet card and its drivers and software without a physical network. [3]

### Terminal 2:
Starting MiniNet Topology

Running MiniNet topology with single Switch & 4 Hosts configuration
```sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13 --topo=single,4```

_Mininet options_ [4],[5]

--controller = default|none|nox|ovsc|ref|remote|ryu[,param (ip) =value (loopback address 127.0.0.1)] 

--mac = Automatically set Host MAC address

--switch = default|ivs|lxbr|ovs|ovsbr|ovsk|user[,param (protocols) =value (OpenFlow13)]

--topo = Network Topology options linear|minimal|reversed|single|torus|tree[,value (4 Hosts)

![Mininet Running](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/mn-running.jpeg)

Fig.3: Mininet Running

Open Terminal 3 & start RYU manager. Then, in the mininet prompt of terminal 2 ping all the hosts [6]

```
mininet> pingall
*** Ping: testing ping reachability
h1 -> h2 h3 h4 
h2 -> h1 h3 h4 
h3 -> h1 h2 h4 
h4 -> h1 h2 h3 
*** Results: 0% dropped (12/12 received)
mininet> 

```

### Terminal 3:
Starting the SDN Controller 

Running the SDN controller tesat script ```ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_13```

Here 13 represents the OpenFlowProtocol_VERSION_1.3 [7], [8]

Fig.4: RYU-Running

### Terminal 4:
Checking the captured packets

First we will check the **OpenVswitch status** by running ```sudo ovs-vsctl show```

![OpenVswitch Status](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Packet_Dump.jpeg)

Fig.5: OpenVswitch Status & Dumped Packets

Here _s1 = switch_, and _s1-eth1, s1-eth2, s1-eth3, s1-eth4 are connected virtual Hosts_.

Now, we will check the dumped packets by running ```sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1```

_ovs-ofctl options_ [9]

-O, --protocols = set allowed OpenFlow versions (default: OpenFlow10, OpenFlow11, OpenFlow12, OpenFlow13, OpenFlow14)
dump-flows = Mention SWITCH (print all flow entries of the specific one)

## 3. Results
Wireshark packet dump (**OFPT_FLOW_MOD**) demonstrating Match & Action protocol
