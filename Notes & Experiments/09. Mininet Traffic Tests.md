# Mininet Traffic Tests

## 1. TCP/UDP concepts

The flow of traffic across the Internet is on the basis of protocols which are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)[1]. As data moves along a network, various attributes are added to the file to create a frame. This process is called encapsulation. There are different methods of encapsulation depending on which protocol and topology are being used. As a result, the frame structure of these packets differ as well[2].

**TCP vs UDP protocol: Differences**
|TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)|UDP (User Datagram Protocol)|
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
|**Connection oriented**. Establish connection before transmitting data & close connection after the communication is done|**Connection-less** protocol having no compulsion for establishing, maintaining and terminating a connection between nodes|
|TCP transmissions are **sent in a sequence** and they are received in the same sequence. In the event of data segments arriving in wrong order, TCP reorders and delivers application|In the case of UDP, sent message **sequence may not be maintained** when it reaches receiving application. There is absolutely no way of predicting the order in which message will be received.|
|TCP uses both **error detection and error recovery**. Errors are detected via checksum and if a packet is erroneous, it is not acknowledged by the receiver, which triggers a retransmission by the sender.|UDP works on a "best-effort" basis. The protocol supports error detection via checksum but when an error is detected, the packet is discarded. Retransmission of the packet for **recovery from that error is not attempted**[3] |
|TCP is suited for applications that require **high reliability**, and transmission time is relatively less critical|UDP is suitable for applications that need **fast, efficient transmission**, such as games, media streaming etc|
|The speed is **slower** than the UDP.|UDP is **faster** because error recovery is not attempted. It is a "best effort" protocol.|
