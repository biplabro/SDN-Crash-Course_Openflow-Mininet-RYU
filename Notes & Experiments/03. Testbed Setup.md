## 1. Installing Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04.X Desktop Edition

**1.1. Updating the packages & installing pre-requisites** [1]
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```

**1.2. Installing DeadSnakes PPA for obtaining latest Python distributions**

```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa```

**1.3. Installing Python 3.7**

```sudo apt install python3.7```

**1.4. Check installation**

```python3.7 --version```

It should give output as below:

```Python 3.7.9```

**Troubleshooting**

In some distributions, Python 3.6 comes by default & ```python3``` calls v 3.6 instead of 3.7. To resolve this issue we need to set v3.7 as the first preference using ```update-alternatices``` command [2]

```sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.7 1```
or
```sudo update-alternatives --config python3``` and select desired option.

![Python Default](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/python3.7-default.png)

**1.5. Installing & updating pip3 repository** [3]

```sudo apt install python3-pip```

##### Troubleshooting with Python 3.7
apt_pkg related errors that breaks the apt package management system.

This error will often occur when a newer version of python has been installed alongside an older version e.g;
- Ubuntu 18.04.1 ships with python version 3.6.6
- Installed ppa:deadsnakes/python3.7.1 or alternative
- Run a command that uses the apt_pkg module and get an error such as ```sudo apt update```;


When we install a non-distro python3 version with apt it will set a shared module directory to be that of python3 most usually it will be ```/usr/lib/python3```
    
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/cnf-update-db", line 8, in <module>
    from CommandNotFound.db.creator import DbCreator
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/CommandNotFound/db/creator.py", line 11, in <module>
    import apt_pkg
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apt_pkg'
```

Most of the time this will be ok, but under some circumstances the different versions of python rely on different libraries or shared objects/libraries than the other python version does, so as other answers have pointed out we need to link the .SO to the correct python version. So if we have python3.6 installed on a 64bit system then the apt_pkg .SO link would be:

```sudo ln -s apt_pkg.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so```

But the problem lies in the fact that when we install a newer python version the link will update to point to the newest python version, which leads to the error of apt_pkg module not being found. By checking which version of python ships with your distro you can create the link as shown above. Or we use a method to offer the command a choice of python versions to link the .SO such as:

```sudo ln -s apt_pkg.cpython-{37m}-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so```

Thus we need to symlink the distro specific .so file to the apt_pkg.so file [4]

#### Python 2.7 Installation (Optional)

**Installing python, gcc & other essential packages** 

```sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get install git gcc python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev python-pip; sudo apt autoremove```

![update & install tools](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/update.png)

Python 2.7.x will be installed. It is suggested to run the above line of codes twice if installing for the first time. 

##### Troubleshooting with Python 2.7
In some OS installation the ```ryu-manager --version``` command might come up with errors. To fix this we need to install an additional package called *tinyrpc version 0.9.4* from the pip repository. RYU comes with tinyrpc latest version, which is not compatible in python 2.7 RYU. So we need to install lower version of tinyrpc.

```sudo pip install tinyrpc==0.9.4```

## 2. Testbed Tools Installation

**Required Tools**

	mininet
	openvswitch
	iperf
	curl
	hping3
	apache bench
	wireshark
	ryu
All the above tools can be downloaded using the default package manager 'apt' except for ryu. RYU will be downloaded from the pip repository

##### 2.1 Mininet Installation
```sudo apt-get install -y mininet```

##### 2.2 Openvswitch Installation
```sudo apt-get install openvswitch-switch```

##### 2.3 Traffic Test Tools installation
```sudo apt-get install iperf; sudo apt-get install curl; sudo apt-get install hping3; sudo apt-get install apache2-utils```

##### 2.4 Wireshark Installation
```sudo apt-get install -y wireshark```

##### 2.5 RYU installation
```pip3 install ryu```

**Troubleshooting**
```
ubuntu@ubuntu1804:~$ pip3 install ryu
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/pip3", line 7, in <module>
    from pip._internal.cli.main import main
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pip._internal'
```
Solution:

Installing pip3 by using python3 & upgrading pip [5]

```python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip```


It is always SAFE to re-run the above installation codes to double check if everything is properly installed in the system. The third & final stage of verification is to check the installed versions of the software as well.

	mn --version
	ovs-vsctl --version
	iperf --version
	wireshark --version	
	ryu-manager --version
