# Traditional Switch vs SDN Switch

In connection with the [previous experiment](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/06.%20Address%20Resolution%20Experiment.md#31-arp-demo), we will try to conduct the same experiment (host-1 ping host-3) to achieve similar results with an SDN switch & learn the differences.

## 1. Traditional Switch (L2)

An L2 Switch is a data link layer packet switch. Its main role is to forward data link layer frames from the source end node to the destination end node within a LAN, **by looking at the destination MAC address** in the frame header[1]. Layer 3 switches have the capability of layer 2 switches to forward using destination MAC address but also the the capability to forward using layer 3 information (destination IP address)[2].

**Control Plane:** 
Learns the MAC Address from the incoming packet (initialized by ARP) and populate the MAC Table (Forwarding Table).

**Data Plane:**
When a packet needs to be sent, an L2 switch `Reads the Destination MAC from frame Header` -->> `Look-up the Forwarding Table for Destination PORT` -->> `Forwards the packet to the assigned PORT`.

**Openvswitch is softswitch, which works as normal switch(traditional) as well as SDN(openflow)switch**

### 1.1 Traditional Switch Demo

**Print the stored Configuration Database content of OpenvSwitch**

The ovs-vsctl program configures ovs-vswitchd by providing a high-level interface to its configuration database[3]. ovs-vsctl connects to an ovsdb-server process that maintains an OpenvSwitch configuration database.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-vsctl show
6dae7e99-a508-4bc4-8a6b-2ad65b8a8312
    Bridge "s1"
        Controller "tcp:127.0.0.1:6653"
        fail_mode: standalone
        Port "s1-eth4"
            Interface "s1-eth4"
        Port "s1-eth2"
            Interface "s1-eth2"
        Port "s1-eth1"
            Interface "s1-eth1"
        Port "s1-eth3"
            Interface "s1-eth3"
        Port "s1"
            Interface "s1"
                type: internal
    ovs_version: "2.9.5"
```

**Ping all clients using mininet**
```
mininet> pingall
*** Ping: testing ping reachability
h1 -> h2 h3 h4 
h2 -> h1 h3 h4 
h3 -> h1 h2 h4 
h4 -> h1 h2 h3 
*** Results: 0% dropped (12/12 received)
mininet> 
```

**Show content of the Forwarding DB content of Switch (s1)**

Open vSwitch daemons accept certain commands at runtime to control their behavior and query their settings.[4] 
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-appctl fdb/show s1
 port  VLAN  MAC                Age
    1     0  00:00:00:00:00:01    3
    2     0  00:00:00:00:00:02    3
    4     0  00:00:00:00:00:04    3
    3     0  00:00:00:00:00:03    3
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$
```

**Dump the traffic in the OVS datapaths**

The ovs-dpctl program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch datapaths.  A single machine may host any number of datapaths.[5]
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-dpctl dump-flows 
recirc_id(0),in_port(5),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:04,dst=00:00:00:00:00:02),eth_type(0x0806), packets:0, bytes:0, used:never, actions:3
recirc_id(0),in_port(4),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:03,dst=00:00:00:00:00:04),eth_type(0x0806), packets:1, bytes:42, used:7.937s, actions:5
recirc_id(0),in_port(2),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dst=00:00:00:00:00:03),eth_type(0x0806), packets:0, bytes:0, used:never, actions:4
recirc_id(0),in_port(2),eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dst=00:00:00:00:00:04),eth_type(0x0806), packets:1, bytes:42, used:7.937s, actions:5
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ ^C
```

**Working procedure & Inferences**

- Traditional Switches comes with built-in Control & Data planes.
- MAC table is initially empty when the switch starts. Now the forwarding table comes into picture.
- From the incoming packets, **Control plane**, updates the MAC table & map with PORT numbers.
- When packets arrive, the **Data Plane** looks at the MAC table & if a suitable match is found, the packet is forwarded to respective port. 

## 2. SDN (OpenFlow) Switch

OpenFlow is a communication protocol in the area of software-defined networking (SDN). It enables to access the control plane of a router or a switch and to control the forwarding of packets[6].

- This allows the control logic of the network to move to an external controller.
- The routing of packets is no longer controlled by the router or the switch, but by the application in the controller.

![Fig.1: OpenFlow Switch](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/OpenFlow-protocol.jpg)

Fig.1: OpenFlow Switch

An OpenFlow switch is an OpenFlow-enabled data switch that communicates over OpenFlow channel to an external controller. It performs packet lookup and forwarding according to one or more flow tables and a group table. The OpenFlow switch communicates with the controller and the controller manages the switch via the OpenFlow switch protocol. OpenFlow switches are either based on the OpenFlow protocol or compatible with it[7].

**SDN Switch over Traditional Switch**
- With OpenFlow switch, the SDN controller could route noncritical/bulk traffic on longer routes that are not fully utilized.
- The SDN controller can easily implement load-balancing at high data rates by just directing different flows to different hosts, only doing the set-up of the initial flowâ€™s.
- Traffic can be isolated without the need for VLANs, the SDN controller of the OpenFlow switch can just refuse certain connections.
- Setup a network TAP/Sniffer easily for any port or even specific traffic by programming the network to send a duplicate stream to a network monitoring device.
- OpenFlow switch allows for the development of new services and ideas all in software on the SDN controller, as well to accelerate new features and services.

### 2.1 SDN Switch Demo

**Starting the Mininet topology**

```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac -i 10.1.1.0/24 --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13 --topo=linear,4
*** Creating network

```

`--controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1` controller is **mapped** with `localhost` IP.

`--mac` sets host mac adresses automatically.

`-i 10.1.1.0/24` represents the subnet in which all host IPS will be assigned by the controller.

`--switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13` OVSswitch with OpenFlow protocol version 1.3

`--topo=linear,4` Linear topology with 4 Hosts

**Starting wireshark to capture the loopback interface**

![Fig.2: Wireshark-SDN](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/ws-sdn1.jpg)

Fig.2: Wireshark-SDN

There is no controller pointed at the 127.0.0.1 IP, thus we need to run **ryu-manager app** to deploy as SDN controller.

**Starting the SDN controller RYU**

`ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_13` here simple_switch is a default SDN controller template. 

**Ping Hosts using mininet**
```
mininet> h1 ping h3
PING 10.1.1.3 (10.1.1.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.1.1.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.391 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.3: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.049 ms
^C
--- 10.1.1.3 ping statistics ---

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.049/0.220/0.391/0.171 ms
mininet> 
```
Ping to host3 is successful as shown above.

**Checking the flows (installed rules) of SDN**

Flow in SDN network can be considered as the rules based on which OVS forwards the packets[8].

![Fig.3: Flow-SDN](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/SDN%20Flow.png)

Fig.3: Flow-SDN

Flows (rules) installed in **s1**
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1
 cookie=0x0, duration=6.549s, table=0, n_packets=8, n_bytes=728, priority=1,in_port="s1-eth2",dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:03,dl_dst=00:00:00:00:00:01 actions=output:"s1-eth1"
 cookie=0x0, duration=6.548s, table=0, n_packets=7, n_bytes=630, priority=1,in_port="s1-eth1",dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dl_dst=00:00:00:00:00:03 actions=output:"s1-eth2"
 cookie=0x0, duration=10.773s, table=0, n_packets=27, n_bytes=3470, priority=0 actions=CONTROLLER:65535
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ 
```
The  ovs-ofctl  program  is  a command line tool for monitoring and administering OpenFlow switches. It can also show the current state of an OpenFlow switch,  including  features, configuration, and table entries. It should work with any OpenFlow switch, not just OpenvSwitch[9].

`-O OpenFlow13` set allowed OpenFlow version to 1.3. 
`dump-flows s1` Prints to the console all flow entries in switch's tables that match flows. If flows is omitted, all flows in the switch are retrieved.

**Working Procedure**

* Switch is configured with SDN Controller IP localhost and Openflow protocol version.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-vsctl show
6dae7e99-a508-4bc4-8a6b-2ad65b8a8312
***
    Bridge "s1"
        Controller "tcp:127.0.0.1:6653"
            is_connected: true
***
    ovs_version: "2.9.5"
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ 
```

* Switch establishes the communication between **Hosts & SDN Controller**.

![Fig.4: Switch-Bridge](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/SDN_port.png)

Fig.4: Switch-Bridge

* SDN Controller installs the default Openflow rule (**TABLE MISS ENTRY**) in the switch Flow table. A table-miss entry can be thought of as a **default entry** to let a packet know that if there is no match, then it is to be sent to the controller[10]. The priority is lowest in the table(0).

`cookie=0x0, duration=10.773s, table=0, n_packets=27, n_bytes=3470, priority=0 actions=CONTROLLER:65535`

![Fig.5: Handling Table-Miss entry](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/Table-miss%20entry.png)

Fig.5: Handling Table-Miss entry

* When the Host Data Packet arrives in the Switch, It will be matched with TABLE MISS ENTRY , and the packet will be sent it to Controller ( PACKET IN Message) .

![Fig.6: Packet-IN broadcast (ARP)](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/SDN-packet-in(ARP).png)

Fig.6: Packet-IN broadcast (ARP)

Wireshark ARP dump. Sender IP address: 10.1.1.1 (h1) and Target IP address 10.1.1.3 (h3)
```
        Address Resolution Protocol (request)
            Hardware type: Ethernet (1)
            Protocol type: IPv4 (0x0800)
            Hardware size: 6
            Protocol size: 4
            Opcode: request (1)
            Sender MAC address: 00:00:00_00:00:01 (00:00:00:00:00:01)
            Sender IP address: 10.1.1.1
            Target MAC address: 00:00:00_00:00:00 (00:00:00:00:00:00)
            Target IP address: 10.1.1.3
```

* Controller receives & decodes the packet, build the Switch Logic with the packets and installs the flows in Switch.

`cookie=0x0, duration=6.548s, table=0, n_packets=7, n_bytes=630, priority=1,in_port="s1-eth1",dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dl_dst=00:00:00:00:00:03 actions=output:"s1-eth2"`

The above rule says that when the source port is "s1-eth1", source MAC is 00:00:00:00:00:01 (h1) and destination MAC is 00:00:00:00:00:03 (h3), forward the packet to "s1-eth2" port.

`cookie=0x0, duration=10.773s, table=0, n_packets=27, n_bytes=3470, priority=0 actions=CONTROLLER:65535`

The above rule says that when a packet is arrived at port no 65535, redirect it to the Controller.

* Switch data path is built with flows. So next time, when the Packet arrives it will be matched with the Flow table and forward the packet to respective port.

## 3. conclusion

W.R.T the above experiments, in Traditional switches, the MAC table is responsible for forwarding packets inside the network where the switch takes care of all the incoming & outgoing traffic. 
* In a Traditional network consisting multiple switches, each switch will have its own forwarding table, thus Traditional routing have a distributed control plane.

In contrary, SDN switches acts as bridge between Hosts & controller where the controller is responsible for defining the flow table & the switch is responsible for forwarding the data packets.
* In an SDN network, all the switches can be configured with the same specific IP for Network controller that manages all the flows, thus SDN routing uses a centralized control plane.
