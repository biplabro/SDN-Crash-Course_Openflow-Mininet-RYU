# Networking Basics

## 1. Network Layers

To understand the core concepts & functionality of a network, it is divided in multiple segments depending on their tasks, protocols & specifications. Each such segment is called a Layer. 

In a software defined network, these segments are majorly divided into 4 layers unlike the 7 layer OSI model which can deconstruct a traditional network scheme in greater detail.

### 1.1 Similarities between OSI and TCP / IP Reference Models

* Both the reference models are based upon layered architecture. The layers in the models are compared with each other. [2]
* The physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model correspond to the link layer of the TCP/IP model. 
* The network layers and the transport layers are the same in both the models. 
* The session layer, presentation layer and application layer of the OSI model together form the application layer of the TCP/IP model.
* In both the models, protocols are defined in a layer-wise manner.
* In both models, data is divided into packets and each packet may take the individual route from the source to the destination.

### 1.2 Differences between OSI and TCP / IP Reference Models

|OSI Model|TCP/IP Model|
|:---------:|:------------:|
|Functionality oriented layer separation|Protocol oriented layer separation|
|Focuses on guidelines of communication|Focuses on protocol implementation of communication|
|Model first, Protocols are derived|Protocols First, Models is derived|
|Consists of 7 layers|Consists of 4 layers|

## 2. Packet Capture Engine

> A **packet** is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them. [3]

**WireShark Features**
* GUI based network traffic capture & protocol analyzer
* It can capture packets from multiple interfaces like Ethernet, USB, Serial port, Loopback address etc.
* Default feature of structured representation of the captured data packet

### 2.1 Wireshark Example

In the below example we will try to capture data packets & interpret the information by the following steps 

```Starting Wireshark to capture "all interfaces" -->> Ping/ curl a certain website using Linux terminal -->> Analyze captured data packets to extract information.```

Initialization of wireshark tool & setting the capture interface to "any" for capturing all ongoing traffic.

**Extracted Information**

  1. Packet is `unicasted` (IP + MAC identifier) to user/client from google. `Router vendor: Xiaomi, Router MAC: 50:64:2B:CE:B2:55`
  2. Source IP (google): `142.250.67.206`, Destination IP (client): `192.168.31.197`
  3. TCP Port: user ==> `80 (HTTP)`, Google ==> 43638
  4. Received HTTP `response Header`
  5. Received `text` from [google.com](www.google.com)
