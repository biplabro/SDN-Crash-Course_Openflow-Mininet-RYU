# Networking Basics

## 1. Network Layers

To understand the core networking concepts & functionality of a network, it is divided in multiple segments depending on their tasks & specifications. Each such segment is called a Layer. 

In a software defined network these, layers are majorly divided into 4 layers unlike the 7 layer OSI model which can deconstruct a traditional network scheme in greater detail.

### 1.1 Similarities between OSI and TCP / IP Reference Models

* Both the reference models are based upon layered architecture. The layers in the models are compared with each other. 

* The physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model correspond to the link layer of the TCP/IP model. 

The network layers and the transport layers are the same in both the models. 

The session layer, the presentation layer and the application layer of the OSI model together form the application layer of the TCP/IP model.

In both the models, protocols are defined in a layer-wise manner.

In both models, data is divided into packets and each packet may take the individual route from the source to the destination.
