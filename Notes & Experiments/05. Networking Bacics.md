# Networking Basics

## 1. Network Layers

To understand the core networking concepts & functionality of a network, it is divided in multiple segments depending on their tasks & specifications. Each such segment is called a Layer. 

In a software defined network these, layers are majorly divided into 4 layers unlike the 7 layer OSI model which can deconstruct a traditional network scheme in greater detail.

### 1.1 Similarities between OSI and TCP / IP Reference Models

* Both the reference models are based upon layered architecture. The layers in the models are compared with each other. [2]

* The physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model correspond to the link layer of the TCP/IP model. 

* The network layers and the transport layers are the same in both the models. 

* The session layer, the presentation layer and the application layer of the OSI model together form the application layer of the TCP/IP model.

* In both the models, protocols are defined in a layer-wise manner.

* In both models, data is divided into packets and each packet may take the individual route from the source to the destination.

### Differences between OSI and TCP / IP Reference Models

|OSI Model|TCP/IP Model|
|:---------:|:------------:|
|Functionality oriented layer separation|Protocol oriented layer separation|
|Focuses on guidelines of communication|Focuses on protocol implementation of communication|
|Model first, Protocols are derived|Protocols First, Models are derived|
|Consists of 7 layers|Consists of 4 layers|
