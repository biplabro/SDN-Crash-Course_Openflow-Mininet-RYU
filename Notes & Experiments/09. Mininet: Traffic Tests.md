# Mininet: Traffic Tests

## 1. TCP/UDP concepts

The flow of traffic across the Internet is on the basis of protocols which are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)[1]. As data moves along a network, various attributes are added to the file to create a frame. This process is called encapsulation. There are different methods of encapsulation depending on which protocol and topology are being used. As a result, the frame structure of these packets differ as well[2].

Fig.1 TCP vs UDP frame header

**TCP vs UDP protocol: Differences**
|TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)|UDP (User Datagram Protocol)|
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
|**Connection oriented**. Establish connection before transmitting data & close connection after the communication is done|**Connection-less** protocol having no compulsion for establishing, maintaining and terminating a connection between nodes|
|TCP transmissions are **sent in a sequence** and they are received in the same sequence. In the event of data segments arriving in wrong order, TCP reorders and delivers application|In the case of UDP, sent message **sequence may not be maintained** when it reaches receiving application. There is absolutely no way of predicting the order in which message will be received.|
|TCP uses both **error detection and error recovery**. Errors are detected via checksum and if a packet is erroneous, it is not acknowledged by the receiver, which triggers a retransmission by the sender.|UDP works on a "best-effort" basis. The protocol supports error detection via checksum but when an error is detected, the packet is discarded. Retransmission of the packet for **recovery from that error is not attempted**[3] |
|TCP is suited for applications that require **high reliability**, and transmission time is relatively less critical|UDP is suitable for applications that need **fast, efficient transmission**, such as games, media streaming etc|
|The speed is **slower** than the UDP.|UDP is **faster** because error recovery is not attempted. It is a "best effort" protocol.|

### 1.1 iPerf Tool

iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth & **performance testing** on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6, HTTP etc). For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters[4]. iPerf tool can be used in figuring out network configuration flaws & making **DoS attacks**[5] to a specific server. 
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ iperf --version
iperf version 2.0.10 (2 June 2018) pthreads
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ 
```

### 1.2 Apache Bench

Apache Bench (ab) is a tool from the Apache organization for benchmarking a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) web server. Although it is designed to measure the performance of Apache web server, yet it can also be used to test any other web server[6]. This tool can be installed in ubuntu systems by running `sudo apt install apache2-utils` command. 

```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ ab -V

ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ 
```

### 1.3 cURL cli tool

curl is a command line tool to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). curl is powered by Libcurl[7]. It can be installed using `sudo apt install curl`

```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ curl --version
curl 7.58.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.58.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1 zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4 libpsl/0.19.1 (+libidn2/2.0.4) nghttp2/1.30.0 librtmp/2.3

ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$

### 1.4 Running a topology with controller

We will use `ryu controller` & mininet linear topology with 4 hosts in this demo. Separate xterm terminal used for each individual hosts. 
* ryu command: `ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_13`
* mininet command: `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac -i 10.1.1.0/24 --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13 --topo=linear,4  -x`
> The trailing `-x` in the above mininet command specifies that each individual network element (controller, switches & hosts) will pop up as a separate xterm window.

## 2. TCP Traffic Tests

In one host we have to start a TCP server & other host will act as client to communicate with each other. 

Running TCP server: Initializing tcp server in host-4. command executed in h4 terminal: `iperf -s`. The `s` tells that its a server.

Running TCP client: Host-1, 2 & 3 are selected as client & the iperf will try to communicate with h4 using `10.1.1.4` ip address from the respective terminals. 
Commands: 

* `iperf -c 10.1.1.4 -i 2 -t 10` (Host-1)
* `iperf -c 10.1.1.4 -i 2 -t 10 -b 10m` (Host-2)
* `iperf -c 10.1.1.4 -i 2 -t 10 -P 5` (Host-3)

![Fig.2 TCP test iPerf](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/iperf-tcp.png)

Fig.2 TCP test iPerf

In the parallel connection command each of the client connections uses **different port number** to connect to the same TCP server port 5001.

|Options|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|`-c` | client mode, specify the server ip (10.1.1.4)|
|`-i` | network statistics report interval (in seconds)|
|`-t` | test duration (in seconds)|
|`-b` | specify communication bandwidth between two nodes (m= megaBits, g= gigaBits). Default is 1 Mbit/sec in UDP (-u)|
|`-P` | number of parallel connections to server[8]|

**Flows of traffic from SDN perspective**
```
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1
 cookie=0x0, duration=2518.681s, table=0, n_packets=1851396, n_bytes=122193772, priority=1,in_port="s1-eth2",dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:04,dl_dst=00:00:00:00:00:01 actions=output:"s1-eth1"
 cookie=0x0, duration=2518.680s, table=0, n_packets=2105521, n_bytes=92870764874, priority=1,in_port="s1-eth1",dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dl_dst=00:00:00:00:00:04 actions=output:"s1-eth2"
 cookie=0x0, duration=2881.126s, table=0, n_packets=25, n_bytes=1864, priority=0 actions=CONTROLLER:65535
ubuntu@ubuntu18-04:~$ 
```

**Results: **

We can refer to [Mininet Linear Topology](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/Notes%20%26%20Experiments/08.%20Mininet%20Topologies.md#23-linear-topology).
* `cookie=0x0, duration=2518.680s, table=0, n_packets=2105521, n_bytes=92870764874, priority=1,in_port="s1-eth1",dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:01,dl_dst=00:00:00:00:00:04 actions=output:"s1-eth2"` when the incoming port is `s1-eth1`, source MAC is `00:00:00:00:00:01` **(h1)** and destination MAC is `00:00:00:00:00:04` **(h4)** the packet is forwarded to `s1-eth2` port of switch-1 **(s1)**. The **flow is installed & running properly** thus we are able to ping the hosts. 

## 3. UDP Traffic Tests

Running UDP Server: For initializing the server (Host-1) the UDP test has the same command except that it includes `-u` to specify it is UDP traffic. Command: `iperf -u -s`. 

Running UDP Clients: Host-2, 3 & 4 are selected as client & the iperf will try to communicate with h1 using `10.1.1.1` ip address from the respective terminals. 
Commands: 

* `iperf -u -c 10.1.1.1 -i 2 -t 10` (Host-2)
* `iperf -u -c 10.1.1.1 -i 2 -t 10 -P 5` (Host-3)
* `iperf -u -c 10.1.1.1 -i 2 -t 10 -b 10m` (Host-4)

Fig.3 UDP test iPerf

## 4. HTTP Traffic Tests

First we need to **run an HTTP web server** (Host-3), for this we will use the default HTTP server teplate that comes preinstalled with python package. 
* Command: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`. 

Here the `-m` flag represents that the argument `SimpleHTTPServer` is a module name, we must not give a file extension (.py). It enables the module to be executed as an executable file[9]. `80` specifies the HTTP port else a random port will be selected by default which we want to avoid. 

Next we will **request the content of the url hosted by the server** (Host-3) residing in mininet topology. For this `curl` cli tool is used. Command: `curl http://10.1.1.3/` from Host-2.

If we want to simulate multiple users (load) accessing the web server on the same time, we can use ab (apache bench) tool. Command: `ab -c 50 -n 500 http://10.1.1.3/`. This command will generate **50 HTTP requests per second totaling the number of 500** during the test from Host-4.

|Options|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|`-n`|requests, Number of requests to perform for the benchmarking session. The default is to just perform a single request which usually leads to non-representative benchmarking results. Hence we need to increase the number in order to get a realistic view of the performance|
|`-c`|concurrency[10], Number of multiple requests to perform at a time. Default is one request at a time|

![Fig.4 HTTP test](https://github.com/biplabro/SDN-hands-on_Openflow-Mininet-RYU/blob/master/images/ab-http.png)

**Results:**

Here is the results of the Apache Benchmark test, server= h3, client= h4.
